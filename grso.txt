Student Organization of the Year - GRSO Award
Nominee: Data Science & Informatics Club (DSI)
1. Successful Recruitment and Retention of Organization Members
The Data Science & Informatics Club (DSI) has demonstrated unparalleled growth over the
past year, solidifying itself as one of UF’s most impactful student organizations. In the current
academic year alone:
● Our Discord community grew from 300 to 1,100 members, making it one of the most
active technical student spaces at UF.
● Our Instagram following surged from 900 to 1,500, reflecting our strong engagement
and outreach.
● We received 70+ applications for our Junior Executive Board, demonstrating high
interest in leadership roles.
DSI’s recruitment strategy is intentional and inclusive. Unlike many technical organizations that
focus on students with prior experience, we actively welcome students of all majors and skill
levels. Our beginner-friendly workshops, mentorship programs, and community-driven approach
ensure high retention, as students feel supported, challenged, and inspired.
We also foster interdisciplinary collaboration, encouraging members to engage with other UF
student organizations. This philosophy has allowed us to maintain a diverse and engaged
membership, where students not only develop technical skills but also build meaningful
professional networks.
2. Impact on the Campus Community
DSI has transformed the UF student experience by providing career-defining opportunities,
bridging academia, industry, and innovation. Our impact is best demonstrated through our three
largest initiatives:
NVIDIA Deep Learning Workshop (Fall 2024) - Largest AI Workshop at UF
● In partnership with UF Information Technology (UFIT), DSI organized a month-long,
hands-on NVIDIA Deep Learning certification series.
● Over 400 students registered, with 350 actively participating (150 in-person, 200 online).
● Students gained practical AI skills and official NVIDIA certifications, enhancing their
career prospects.
● This event showcased our ability to coordinate large-scale, high-impact educational
experiences at UF.
ShellHacks Participation (Fall 2024) - Florida’s Largest Hackathon
● With the help of UF CISE, DSI coordinated for 54 UF students to attend ShellHacks,
Florida’s largest hackathon.
● Unlike most club-sponsored trips, we opened registration to all UF students, regardless
of major or club affiliation, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration.
● DSI handled all logistics, transportation, and event coordination, ensuring an enjoyable
experience for all attendees.
● UF teams excelled at ShellHacks, winning multiple awards (see Awards section).
DSI Spring Symposium (Spring 2025) - Our Yearly Symposium
● Every year, DSI hosts its Spring Research Symposium, a platform for students to:
○ Present their research posters.
○ Attend talks from top industry and academic leaders.
○ Participate in technical workshops.
● In Spring 2025, we are expanding this event to 300 attendees, featuring:
○ A full-day event at the Reitz Union on April 5th, making it one of the largest
student-run technical symposiums at UF.
○ 18 expert speakers from academia, industry, and government.
○ 6 hands-on workshops covering cutting-edge topics in AI, data science, and
machine learning.
These flagship events, along with our weekly workshops, journal club meetings, social events,
technical projects and hackathon initiatives, have made DSI a hub for interdisciplinary learning,
career advancement, and technical skill development at UF.
3. Leadership Opportunities Provided Through Membership
DSI empowers students by providing structured leadership roles and real-world impact
opportunities. Our 31-member Executive Board includes:
● Workshop Coordinators – Students develop and lead hands-on workshops, teaching
peers about AI, machine learning, data science, and technical tools. Coordinators are
responsible for researching topics, preparing instructional materials, and delivering
engaging sessions that provide students with real-world applicable skills.
● Event Coordinators – Manage large-scale events like the NVIDIA Deep Learning
Workshop Series and the Spring Research Symposium, as well as smaller-scale events
such as movie nights, study sessions, and collaborations with other clubs. These
students are responsible for event logistics, scheduling, and ensuring smooth execution.
● Sponsorship Coordinators – Work with industry leaders, faculty, and UF departments
to secure funding and corporate partnerships (e.g., NVIDIA, UF CISE). They actively
seek sponsorships for major events like the Spring Research Symposium and travel
opportunities like ShellHacks, ensuring that financial constraints do not limit student
participation.
● Networking Coordinators – Establish connections with industry professionals, UF
faculty, and alumni, helping members find internship, job, and research opportunities.
They organize panel discussions, networking events, and career Q&A sessions,
ensuring that DSI members gain valuable career exposure and mentorship.
● Social Media Coordinators – Manage DSI’s digital presence, ensuring that events,
achievements, and opportunities are effectively communicated to both existing and
potential members. This includes creating engaging content for Instagram, Discord,
LinkedIn, and newsletters, as well as coordinating outreach campaigns to attract new
members.
● Webmasters – Maintain and improve DSI’s official website, ensuring it serves as a
central hub for resources, event updates, and membership engagement.
Beyond formal roles, we encourage initiative-driven leadership. Many of our most successful
projects, such as the ShellHacks sponsorship, were initially suggested by members who took
the initiative to bring a challenge to light.
By offering high-impact leadership experiences, DSI equips students with the confidence,
experience, and connections to succeed in graduate programs, industry, and entrepreneurship.
